Fire & Smoke Detection with Real-Time Email Alerts using AI

In this project,
I built a smart surveillance system that detects fire and smoke in real-time using a pre-trained YOLO model. 
Once fire or smoke is detected in a video frame, the system automatically sends an email alert with the detected image attached.

Technologies used:
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection  
- OpenCV for video processing  
- smtplib and email libraries for sending alerts  
- Python as the main programming language

The goal of this project is to provide a proactive fire detection solution that could help in reducing response time in emergency situations.
